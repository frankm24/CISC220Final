Rules for MemSweeper

    Single player
        players are tasked with "freeing" memory.
        Memory is vizualed as a grid of memory locations and values "locked" (greyed out)
        Memory is full of different objects and data structures.
        Players can move through memory by inputing simple commands in the terminal
        A location in memory is "unlocked" when the player has traversed over it and seen the value stored in it
        The goal of the game is to traverse through all of memory, unlocking the grid, in the fewest number of moves
        Moves are displayed in a counter at the top of the board, including players previous high score.
        Moves include:
            updating location by one unit //I think they should be able to update their location by any amount, IE, go to any location on the grid. think about in the instance when they have only 1 location to unlock, but its really far, will they just move right/left 30x times?
            traversing a data structure:
                dereferencing pointers to unlock node/object
                guessing data structure for more turns
                iterating through a data structure through psudo code in the terminal
        Once the player has unlocked all locations in the grid they've completed the game and their score is saved
