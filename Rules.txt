Rules for MemSweeper

    Single player
        players are tasked with "freeing" memory.
        Memory is vizualed as a grid of memory locations and values "locked" (greyed out)
        Memory is full of different objects and data structures.
        Players can move through memory by inputing simple commands in the terminal
        A location in memory is "unlocked" when the player has traversed over it and seen the value stored in it
        The goal of the game is to traverse through all of memory, unlocking the grid, in the fewest number of moves
        Moves are displayed in a counter at the top of the board, including players previous high score.
        Moves include:
            updating location to a different unit//I think they should be able to update their location by any amount, IE, go to any location on the grid. think about in the instance when they have only 1 location to unlock, but its really far, will they just move right/left 30x times?
            traversing a data structure:
                iterating through a data structure through psudo code in the terminal
                dereferencing pointers to unlock node/object ( when they deference a pointer, they unlock the entire object that the pointer points to-not the data structure)
                guessing data structure for more turns
        Once the player has unlocked all locations in the grid they've completed the game and their score is saved
    Multiplayer
        Up to 4 players are placed in random locations on the board // we can build in default buffers so they don't start to close
        Players are distinguished by the color their territory displays in and user name
        game ends when all units in the grid have been found // I was thinking it doesn't make sense to use turns in multiplayer if were having them win by most territory. this would mean the whole guess function is more of a tool for learning for singleplayer
        The player with the most territory at the end wins
    Terminal

        Players interact through the board by inputting simple commands in to a terminal
        commands include:
            loc++
            loc = 0Xffffffff // memory address / dereference pointer and unlock whole object
            loc = endOfArray(loc) // traverses and array starting at inputed memory address and unlocks all members in the array
            loc = endOfLL(loc) // traverses a linked list and unlocks all nodes attached
            // we could implement a similar function for binary trees, but they might be too much territory unlocked and are also one way so you can't find the root and will only get youre node down, just something to think about
            guess X // where X is a data structure. In single player mode players can guess data structures to earn turns back. 
            //more to implement
